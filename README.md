## Debugging

The log of your script, successful or not, will be saved to `~/komputer-maschine.log`.

Read through it to see if you can debug the issue yourself.
If not, report where the script failed into a [new GitHub Issue](https://github.com/heldinz/komputer-maschine/issues/new).

## Known Issues

Cask does not recognize applications installed outside of Homebrew Cask – in the case that the script fails, you can either remove the application from the install list or uninstall the application causing the failure and try again.
